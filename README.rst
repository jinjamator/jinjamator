Introduction
==================


Jinjamator is an automation framework built to make complex automation tasks as easy and boilerplate free as possible.

Features
-----------------

Jinjamator currently has following features:

    - run tasks written in python3
    - run tasks written in jinja2
    - register functions via content plugin system for python3 and jinja2 tasks, to have the same functionality.
    - run standalone as CLI application
    - run as REST API daemon, exporting tasks via REST API
    - gathering of required user inputs, determined by code inspection
    - validation of user inputs
    - log everthing to a database (daemon mode only, CLI is on roadmap)
    - support of different (customer) environments
    - distributed operation (daemon mode only)
    - output plugin system to further process data generated by tasks (e.g.: generate excel files from everthing)
    - includes a simple single-page javascript webapp for running tasks (automatically generates wizards from the task code)



Content Plugins
-----------------

    - cisco.aci (query apic)
    - ssh (run commands via ssh)
    - fsm (parse ssh outputs to objects via textfsm)
    - log

Many more to come.


Output Plugins
-----------------

    - console (print data to stdout)

Many more to come.
